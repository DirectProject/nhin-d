At one point during NIST and DCDT certification testing we ran into some certificate resolution workflow issues.  

The code name mod phase 3 was the name DCDT used once upon a time for their work in progress certification end point.  

These plugin resolvers were created to pass their tests.  But in a short period of time DCDT and the reference 
Implementations worked out bugs in the existing resolvers and changed some of the work flow certification test.  

So while these plugins are not valid for certification they do show how to write your own plugin resolver to replace
the existing DNS and LDAP resolvers.
