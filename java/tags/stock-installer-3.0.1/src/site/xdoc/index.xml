               The stock deployment is an Java assembly based on the Java Reference Implementation 
               <a href="http://wiki.directproject.org/Bare+Metal+Project">Bare Metal</a> project.  It consists of 
               pre-assembled and partly configured instances of core reference implementation components.  This package
               contains a GUI based installation application to deploy the reference implementation.  Full details can be found in the
               <a href="users-guide/index.html">users guide</a>. 
            </p>
            <p>
               The Java Reference Implementation and Bare Metal projects are not intended to be full blown, production ready
               HISP.  Instead it is a starting point from which a production HISP can be derived and deployed.
