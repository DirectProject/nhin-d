               The DNS services implement a simple authoritative only DNS server for hosting DNS records for a Direct 
               messaging domain. It is intentionally tuned to handle only certain type of DNS records including CERT 
               type records as defined by the security and trust 
               <a href="http://nhindirect.org/Content+Security+for+Simple+Health+Trans">specification.</a>              
            </p>
            <p>
               The server can be run as a stand alone application or may be deployed as an operating system service.
