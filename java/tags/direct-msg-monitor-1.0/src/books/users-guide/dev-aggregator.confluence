h1. Aggregator Component

The aggregator component groups correlated messages together into a single data structure.  The default monitoring deployment uses BasicTxAggregator class to group messages into a collection of message monitoring structures.  

All messages flowing into the monitoring service are represented by the Tx data type.  When the first message of a correlation is received, the aggregator creates a new collection of Tx objects and places the Tx instance into the collection  When subsequent messages are correlated, they Tx object is simply added to the collection.

As you will see in the next section, a BasicTxAggregator instance can be configured as the container for the completion and timeout conditions.
