h1. About this Chapter

This chapters describes tools that accompany the agent source code.

The reference implementation's agent source tree provides a set of tools to assist testing and development.  The tools are located under the /java/agent/tools directory in the source tree.

*NOTE:* You will need to checkout the reference implementation source tree first as described in the direct project software development [process|http://wiki.directproject.org/Software+Development+Process].  You will also need [maven|http://maven.apache.org/] installed to build the tools.  After checking out the source and installing maven, build the tools by running the following command under the /java/agent directory:

{code}
mvn clean install
{code}
