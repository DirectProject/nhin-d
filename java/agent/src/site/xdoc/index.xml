            <p>
               The security and trust agent is responsible for implementing the policies of the security and trust
               <a href="http://nhindirect.org/Content+Security+for+Simple+Health+Trans">specification.</a>  It
               contains interfaces and implementations for resolving private and public certificates, message signing
               and validating message signatures, message encryption, and enforcing trust policies.
            </p>
            <p>
               The agent is typically embedded in an application or service stack interfacing directly with an NHINDAgent
               implementation.  However, because the agent is comprised of componentized sub systems, it is possible to view
               the agent as a library of publicly consumable components and interfaces.
