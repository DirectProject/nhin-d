               The NHIN Direct Gateway module consists of protocol bridges between the NHIN Direct backbone protocol 
               and security and trust agent.  Bridges integrate with the protocol implementation using implementation 
               specific configuration methods.  Take, for example, the Apache James SMTP implementation.  The gateway
               module provides a James bridge in the form of a James mailet called NHINDSecurityAndTrustMailet.  The 
               mailet is configured using the Apache James config.xml file which is part of a standard James deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
               Bridges communicate with a common protocol agent that performs protocol specific logic before delegating
               the message to the security and trust protocol.  Protocol agents consume configuration information in the form
               of a URL which references the configuration data.  Generally the configuration URL is part of the bridge
               deployment configuration.
