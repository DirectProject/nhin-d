The stock deployment is an Java assembly based on the Java Reference Implementation 
Bare Metal project.  It consists of pre-assembled and partly configured instances 
of core reference implementation components.  

The Java Reference Implementation and Bare Metal projects are not intended to be full 
blown, production ready HISP.  Instead it is a starting point from which a production 
HISP can be derived and deployed.
