To install Direct, change directories to the install area:

  cd ~/nhin-d/java/install

Make sure to run mvn:

  mvn clean install

Choose a directory under which to install.  The directory must exists.  The package will be installed in the james-2.3.2 directory beneath the directory under which you install.  If this directory, james-2.3.2, already exists, the installation will not run. If the optional installation directory is not supplied, the install will be performed under build.  

To install:

  sh ./install.sh [<installation-directory>]

To run:

  cd <installation-directory>/james-2.3.2/bin
  sudo -E ./run.sh
