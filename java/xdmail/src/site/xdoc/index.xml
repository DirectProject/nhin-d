               The NHIN Direct XD Mail component consists of a protocol bridge between the NHIN Direct backbone protocol
               and the XD Mail component, and the XD Mail logic.  Bridges integrate with the protocol implementation
               using implementation specific configuration methods.  Take, for example, the Apache James SMTP implementation.
               The XD Mail component provides a James bridge in the form of a James mailet called NHINDMailet.  The mailet
               is configured using the Apache James config.xml file which is part of a standard James deployment.
            </p>
            <p>
               The XD Mail component handles the transformation and forwarding of a protocol specific message, SMTP by
               default, to an XDS message. The XDS request is sent via SOAP to a configured XDR endpoint which will then
               handle any additional routing.  
            </p>
            <p>
               The transformation component handles CDA/CCD attachments, CDA/CCD in body, and XDM.zip attachments.
            </p>
